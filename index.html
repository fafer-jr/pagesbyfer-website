               I have been around computers all my life. My dad is a programmer and I would love watching him work as a kid. However, I never really thought about coding myself
               until I completed an Information Technology certificate through Vincennes University in 2022. I took a few intor level coding classes in multiple languages.
               I learned python, SQL, C#, and HTML. That is where I became fascinated by HTML and building websites from scratch. So let's see where this adventure takes me.
